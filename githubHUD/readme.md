# Github HUD
## Goal
### To reinforce and apply understanding of how to use and implement APIs.
### Learning Objectives
### By the end of this exercise the student will be able to:
### Create a set of snippets
### Attach snippets to any webpage
### Use snippets to make an api call to github in order to display your account information
### Introduction
### For this workshop we’ll be creating a useful set of snippets that can be attached to any webpage (maybe even your portfolio, hint hint). These snippets will make an api call to github and display your account information. 

### Why is this useful? Well this means that this information will always be up to date with your github profile so you don’t need to manually update it. 
### Setup
### Create a new folder for this project with the usual files in it: index.html, main.js, and main.css. 
### Take a look at http//api.github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME (of course substituting YOUR_USERNAME with your own github username). If you’re having trouble reading the output install [this chrome extension](https://goo.gl/FGvA5v)

### Design inspiration :
###  [some codepen](https://codepen.io/hesmaili95/pen/wGzodM) 
### [another codepen](https://codepen.io/lcasleme/pen/RRwrLE) 
### Instructions
### Whenever you’re dealing with API data, the best thing you can do is explore the data before even trying to use it in a project. Take note of where in the data useful things like your profile photo or repository count are. It’s best to jot these down in a document somewhere! 
### In your web page create a box that displays the following:
### Your github photo.
### The amount of repositories you have. 
### A button to visit your github. 
### A list of your repositories [and links to them](http://api.github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/repos)
### A list of your followers with each follower's username and picture
### [followers](https://api.github.com/users/YOUR_USERNAME/followers)
### Once you have this working, don’t forget to style it. Make sure it’s responsive and looks decent. 




### Bonus: Try to replicate the functionality from the first design inspiration link. A user should be able to pass a github username into a input box and you should pull that users data and display it!


### Completion Requirements
### Complete Workshop by end of a lot time limit.
### The completed web page has:
### The student’s github photo.
### A list of their repositories.
### A link to their github.  
### A repository count. 
### The data for these things are added from the API data. 
### A responsive layout
### Group review session for feedback and questions.
