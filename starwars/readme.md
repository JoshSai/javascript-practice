# OMDb API Practice
### Visit the star wars api website [Swapi](https://swapi.co/) and read through the documentation here.
#### 1. Name 4 data points that are available through this API.
#####  [films](https://swapi.co/api/films/)
#####  [people](https://swapi.co/api/people/)
#####  [planets](https://swapi.co/api/planets/)
#####  [species](https://swapi.co/api/species/)
#####  [starships](https://swapi.co/api/starships/)
#####  [vehicles](https://swapi.co/api/vehicles/)
#### 2. Which endpoint would return a listing of all star wars films?
##### [films](https://swapi.co/api/films/)
#### 3. Which endpoint would give you information on the 3rd film?
##### [films/3](https://swapi.co/api/films/3)
#### 4. What would the url look like?
##### see above ^
#### 5. Give an example of what kind of site you could build with this API?
##### A star wars fan site. One option would be to frame out a dynamic website where the user can access the API and input different names, places, properties etc. and build new characters or storylines?
Visit the OMDB api website[oMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/) and read through the documentation.
Lets practice using a form tag to submit a AJAX API call
#### 1. Create a HTML page that has a form tag.
#### 2. The form tag should take in input for a movie title and another input for movie year
#### 3. Use that form to call the omdb API with the values from the form input and append the response onto your page in a div. You can do all the data or just some parts, your call!
Note : By default forms will try to submit and refresh the page. Look into a way to prevent that behavior.
